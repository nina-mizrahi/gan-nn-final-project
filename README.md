# Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) Final Project – CS152

This repository contains the final project for the Neural Networks course (CS152), where we developed and evaluated **GAN** and **Wasserstein GAN (WGAN)** models on the MNIST dataset. We assessed the performance of the generated images using both **FID** (Fréchet Inception Distance) and **SSIM** (Structural Similarity Index) metrics.

## 🔍 Project Overview

The project demonstrates:
- Implementation of standard GAN and WGAN architectures from scratch in PyTorch
- Evaluation of generative quality using both visual inspection and quantitative metrics
- Comparison of training behavior across models using discriminator loss, generator loss, and output trends
- Saving and reloading of model parameters for long-run training checkpoints

## 📊 Evaluation Metrics

- **FID (Fréchet Inception Distance)**: Measures similarity between distributions of real and generated images using feature statistics from a pretrained Inception network.
- **SSIM (Structural Similarity Index)**: Measures image similarity based on luminance, contrast, and structure.

Both metrics are used to quantify the visual quality and realism of generated samples.
